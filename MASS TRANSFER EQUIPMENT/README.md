This project is a web-based application that provides a structured interface to document, configure, and analyze a Shell & Tube Heat Exchanger.
It allows users to:

View fluid property data (density, heat capacity, viscosity).

Enter all design and operational parameters using a clean and user-friendly form.

Specify configuration details like shell/tube passes, flow arrangement, and heat transfer coefficient.

Input hot and cold stream data, as well as tube and shell fluid properties.

Perform calculations or reset inputs easily using dedicated buttons.

The interface is designed using HTML + CSS + js and can be extended with JavaScript for calculations such as LMTD, heat duty, and required heat exchanger area.
